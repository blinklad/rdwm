## DWM-inspired window manager for X

## Goals
Happy hacking. I would love to make a minimalistic, dwm-inspired yet idiomatic clone that could be used as a basis for other Rust WM projects.
Ideally this project would use XCB, as well.

## Running
The provided [build script](run.sh) should work, as long as you have:
1. Xephyr
2. Xterm (or another simple X program, eg. Xeyes)
